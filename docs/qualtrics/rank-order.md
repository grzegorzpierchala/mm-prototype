# Rank Order Question

## About Rank Order Questions

Rank order questions ask respondents to arrange a list of items in order of preference, importance, or another criterion. This question type provides valuable insights into relative priorities and preferences by forcing respondents to make trade-offs between options. Unlike rating scales where multiple items can receive the same score, ranking requires establishing a clear hierarchy.

## When to Use Rank Order Questions

Rank order questions are ideal for:
- Prioritizing features or benefits
- Understanding preference hierarchies
- Comparing multiple options
- Identifying most and least important factors
- Market research and product development
- Educational assessment and evaluation
