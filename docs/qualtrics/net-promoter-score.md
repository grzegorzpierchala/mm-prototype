# Net Promoter Score (NPS) Question

## About Net Promoter Score Questions

The Net Promoter Score (NPS) question is a standardized survey metric used to measure customer loyalty and satisfaction. It asks respondents how likely they are to recommend a product, service, or company to others on a scale of 0-10. This simple yet powerful metric has become an industry standard for tracking customer sentiment and predicting business growth.

## The NPS Question

The standard NPS question format is:

**"How likely are you to recommend [company/product/service] to a friend or colleague?"**

Scale: 0 (Not at all likely) to 10 (Extremely likely)

## NPS Categories

Based on their responses, customers are classified into three groups:

### Promoters (9-10)
- Loyal enthusiasts
- Will keep buying and referring others
- Fuel growth through positive word-of-mouth

### Passives (7-8)
- Satisfied but unenthusiastic
- Vulnerable to competitive offerings
- Won't actively promote or detract

### Detractors (0-6)
- Unhappy customers
- Can damage brand through negative word-of-mouth
- May churn and discourage others

## Calculating NPS

The Net Promoter Score is calculated using this formula:

**NPS = % Promoters - % Detractors**

- Scores range from -100 to +100
- Positive scores indicate more promoters than detractors
- Higher scores generally indicate better customer loyalty

### Example Calculation
- 100 responses total
- 50 Promoters (50%)
- 30 Passives (30%)
- 20 Detractors (20%)
- NPS = 50% - 20% = 30
