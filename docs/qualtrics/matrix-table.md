# Matrix Table Question

## About Matrix Table Questions

Matrix table questions allow you to combine multiple questions that have the same answer choices. This is most useful when you need to ask multiple questions that should be rated on the same scale. Matrix tables present these questions in a grid format where statements are listed on the left and scale points are displayed across the top.

## When to Use Matrix Tables

Matrix tables are ideal when you want to:
- Ask multiple related questions with the same response scale
- Save space in your survey by combining similar questions
- Make it easier for respondents to compare their answers across items
- Collect ratings for multiple items efficiently

## Basic Matrix Table Features

### Statements vs. Scale Points
- **Statements**: The questions or items listed vertically (rows)
- **Scale Points**: The answer choices displayed horizontally (columns)

### Common Uses
- Satisfaction ratings for multiple aspects of a product or service
- Agreement scales for a series of statements
- Frequency ratings for various activities
- Importance ratings for different features

## Matrix Table Variations

### Likert
The most common matrix table type, used for agreement scales (Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree).

### Bipolar
Uses opposing endpoints (e.g., "Very Dissatisfied" to "Very Satisfied").

### Rank Order
Allows respondents to rank items within the matrix.

### Constant Sum
Respondents distribute points across items, with the total adding to a specified sum.

### Multiple Answer
Allows multiple selections per row (checkbox style).

### Single Answer
Allows only one selection per row (radio button style).

## Matrix Table Options

### Forced Response
Requires respondents to answer every row before proceeding.

### Position
Controls the position of scale point labels (top, left, right).

### Repeat Headers
For long matrices, repeats the scale point headers after a certain number of rows.

### Mobile Optimization
- **Accordion**: Collapses matrix into expandable rows on mobile
- **Carousel**: Allows swiping through statements on mobile
- **Standard**: Displays as a scrollable table

## Best Practices

### Keep It Simple
- Limit the number of statements (5-10 is ideal)
- Use clear, concise wording
- Ensure all statements use the same scale appropriately

### Mobile Considerations
- Test your matrix on mobile devices
- Consider using mobile-optimized display options
- Keep scale points to 5-7 for better mobile display

### Avoid Matrix Fatigue
- Break up long lists into multiple smaller matrices
- Vary question types throughout your survey
- Consider using page breaks between matrix questions

## Data Analysis

Matrix table data is typically analyzed by:
- Calculating means and standard deviations for each statement
- Comparing ratings across statements
- Identifying patterns in responses
- Creating visualization like heat maps or spider charts

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Too Many Statements**: Overwhelming respondents with 20+ items in one matrix
2. **Inconsistent Scales**: Mixing different types of ratings in the same matrix
3. **Double-Barreled Statements**: Including multiple concepts in one statement
4. **Unclear Scale Labels**: Using ambiguous or inconsistent scale points
5. **No N/A Option**: Not providing a "Not Applicable" option when needed
