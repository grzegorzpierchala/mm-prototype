# Graphic Slider Question

## [](#Introduction)About Graphic Slider Questions

The graphic slider provides an engaging scale for respondents. It displays an image that changes as the scale adjusts. This format can be particularly useful for younger audiences or for simple satisfaction feedback.

## [](#DataAnalysis)Data Analysis

Once your responses have been collected, Qualtrics offers various ways you can analyze your response data. From the [Reports tab](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/reports-module/results-vs-reports/), you can view aggregate data in pre-made reports as well as create your own reports from scratch. From the [Data & Analysis](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/data-and-analysis-module/data-and-analysis-overview/) tab, you can view and manage individual respondents’ data.

### Visualizations

The visualizations in reports display information by rank. For instance, you can make a bar chart that displays how many people rated 1 on the graphic slider, 2, 3, and so on. You can also display the mean rank given in the question if you change the visualization’s metric to mean.

In the [Results](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/reports-module/results-section/reports-overview/) section of the Reports tab, there are 7 visualization types available for graphic slider questions: [simple table](/support/results/visualizations/tables/simple-table/ "simple table"), [bar chart](/support/results/visualizations/charts/bar-chart/ "bar chart"), [line chart](/support/results/visualizations/charts/line-chart/ "line chart"), [pie chart](/support/results/visualizations/charts/pie-chart/ "pie chart"), [breakdown bar](/support/results/visualizations/breakdown-bar/ "breakdown bar"), [statistics table](/support/results/visualizations/tables/statistics-table/ "statistics table"), and [gauge chart](/support/results/visualizations/charts/gauge-chart/ "gauge chart"). For more information on these visualizations, please visit the linked visualization support pages.

In the [Reports](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/reports-module/reports-section/paginated-reports-overview/) section of the Reports tab, there are similar visualizations available: [data table](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/reports-module/reports-section/reports-visualizations/table-visualizations/data-table-visualization/), [results table](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/reports-module/reports-section/reports-visualizations/table-visualizations/results-table-visualization/), [bar chart](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/reports-module/reports-section/reports-visualizations/chart-visualizations/bar-chart-visualization/), [line chart](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/reports-module/reports-section/reports-visualizations/chart-visualizations/line-chart-visualization/), [pie chart](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/reports-module/reports-section/reports-visualizations/chart-visualizations/pie-chart-visualization/), [breakdown bar](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/reports-module/reports-section/reports-visualizations/chart-visualizations/breakdown-bar-visualization/), [statistics table](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/reports-module/reports-section/reports-visualizations/table-visualizations/statistics-table-visualization/), and [gauge chart](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/reports-module/reports-section/reports-visualizations/chart-visualizations/gauge-chart-visualization/).

### Downloaded Data Format

Your dataset will include a column for each graphic slider question. The value in this column for each participant is the coded value of the scale point they chose. The values will change depending on the graphic slider used.

[![Graphic slider data in a CSV](graphic-slider/image06114.png)](https://www.qualtrics.com/m/assets/support/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image06114.png)

**Example:** On a stoplight slider, “1” is a green light and “3” is a red light. On a smile slider (both horizontal and vertical), “1” is a very sad face and “5” is a very happy face. On a ten gauge slider, “1” is a low pressure and “10” is a high pressure. On a thermometer slider, “1” is a low temperature and “5” is a high pressure. On a grades slider, “1” is a low grade and “5” (without +/-) or “13” (with +/-) is a high grade.
