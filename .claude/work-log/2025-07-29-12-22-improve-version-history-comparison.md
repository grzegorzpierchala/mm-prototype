# Task: Improve Version History Visual Comparison Experience
**Date**: 2025-07-29 12:22
**Status**: Completed
**Category**: Feature Enhancement

## Context
User wants to improve the Version History experience to show true side-by-side previews of survey versions with the ability to see visual diffs (added/modified/removed sections) and also toggle off these indicators for clean visual comparison.

## User Request
"Recently we did improve the Version History but I would like to improve the expierence of it. It's not clear for me when I compare versions what actually changed in the survey it would be cool to have side by side previews that I can actually "diff" like see that this section was removed this section was added. but also to have an option to disable those messages and just show me the preview of one version over the other so I can compare it visually myself (Sometimes it might be easier for someoen that is less technical)"

## Plan
1. Delegate UI/UX design to ui-ux-designer agent
2. Enhance version store with survey snapshots
3. Implement true side-by-side comparison with actual survey content
4. Add toggle for diff highlights
5. Test with qa-playwright-tester
