# Task: Version History Full Width Mode for Comparison
**Date**: 2025-07-29 22:57
**Status**: Completed
**Category**: Feature

## Context
User reports that the Version History panel is too cramped when comparing two versions side by side. The comparison view shows two columns but the limited width makes it difficult to read the content properly.

## User Request
Make the version history panel expand to full width of the screen when 2 versions are selected for comparison.

## Plan
1. Analyze current version history panel implementation
2. Design full-width mode that activates when comparing versions
3. Implement smooth transition to full-width
4. Ensure proper layout for side-by-side comparison
5. Test the implementation

## Implementation Log
### 22:57 - Initial Investigation
- **What**: Creating work log and planning the implementation
- **Files**: Created .claude/work-log/2025-07-29-22-57-version-history-full-width.md
- **Result**: Work log created
- **Notes**: This is a UI/UX task that should be delegated to ui-ux-designer agent

### 23:05 - Implementation Completed
- **What**: Implemented full-width mode for version comparison
- **Files**: 
  - Modified src/components/ui/VersionHistory.js (added dynamic class binding)
  - Modified src/style.css (enhanced transition with cubic-bezier)
- **Result**: Full-width mode now activates automatically when comparing different versions
- **Notes**: The expanded class was already in CSS, just needed conditional application

### 23:10 - Testing Completed
- **What**: Tested the full-width mode implementation
- **Files**: N/A (testing only)
- **Result**: All features working correctly
- **Notes**: Smooth transitions, proper width detection, intuitive UX

## Summary
- **Changes Made**: 
  - Added conditional class binding to detect when different versions are selected
  - Enhanced CSS transition for smoother width animations
  - Full-width mode activates automatically when comparing different versions
- **Files Modified**: 
  - src/components/ui/VersionHistory.js (added expanded class condition)
  - src/style.css (enhanced transition timing)
- **Testing**: Confirmed all features work correctly with smooth transitions
- **Outstanding Items**: None - feature is complete and working as expected
