# Task: Implement Work Audit System
**Date**: 2025-01-27 14:30
**Status**: Completed
**Category**: Feature

## Context
User was concerned that the CLAUDE.md instructions about creating task documentation were being ignored. They wanted a better system to track all work done on the project, similar to how software teams use project management systems with sprints/stories/tasks, but in a kanban style approach. The goal is to have a persistent audit trail to review past work, understand why decisions were made, and see what was implemented.

## User Request
"I would like you to update it in a way that it can be an audit log for me in for all future work. What I mean by it and how I envision it is that when I work in my team we have a project -> backlog and sprints and each sprint has stories/tasks. I dont think we need sprints its more of kanban approach but its nice to be able to go back and see what we worked on, why and what was done if that makes sense."

## Plan
1. Analyze the current CLAUDE.md work documentation instructions
2. Design a hybrid system that combines TodoWrite with persistent file-based logging
3. Update CLAUDE.md with clear, enforceable instructions
4. Create the directory structure for work management
5. Document this meta-task as the first work log entry

## Implementation Log
### 14:30 - Analyzed current CLAUDE.md
- **What**: Read the existing CLAUDE.md file to understand current instructions
- **Files**: CLAUDE.md (lines 14-24)
- **Result**: Found that instructions exist but are vague about triggers and enforcement
- **Notes**: Identified that the instructions needed to be more explicit with clear trigger conditions

### 14:32 - Designed new work management system
- **What**: Created a comprehensive system merging TodoWrite with audit logs
- **Files**: None (design phase)
- **Result**: Designed dual-tracking system with clear workflow phases
- **Notes**: Key insight was to use TodoWrite for active tracking and markdown files for permanent history

### 14:35 - Updated CLAUDE.md
- **What**: Replaced the vague work instructions with detailed work management system
- **Files**: CLAUDE.md (lines 14-95)
- **Result**: Added mandatory work documentation process with template and enforcement rules
- **Notes**: Made triggers explicit, added workflow integration, and provided detailed template

### 14:40 - Created directory structure
- **What**: Created .claude/work-log and .claude/backlog directories
- **Files**: Created directories at .claude/work-log/ and .claude/backlog/
- **Result**: Directory structure ready for work management
- **Notes**: Using timestamps in filenames for chronological ordering

### 14:42 - Created first work log
- **What**: Documented this meta-task as the first work log entry
- **Files**: .claude/work-log/2025-01-27-14-30-implement-work-audit-system.md
- **Result**: Demonstrated the work log format with real example
- **Notes**: This serves as both documentation and example for future work

## Summary
- **Changes Made**: 
  - Redesigned work documentation section in CLAUDE.md with mandatory audit trail system
  - Created dual-tracking approach (TodoWrite + work logs)
  - Established clear trigger conditions and workflow phases
  - Added comprehensive work log template
  
- **Files Modified**: 
  - CLAUDE.md (lines 14-95) - Complete rewrite of work management section
  - Created .claude/work-log/ directory
  - Created .claude/backlog/ directory
  - Created this work log file
  
- **Testing**: 
  - Successfully created directory structure
  - This work log serves as proof of concept
  
- **Outstanding Items**: 
  - Future work logs will follow this pattern
  - Backlog directory ready for future user stories
  - System ready for immediate use on next task
