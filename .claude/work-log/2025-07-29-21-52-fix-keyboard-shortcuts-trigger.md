# Task: Fix Keyboard Shortcuts Trigger Issues
**Date**: 2025-07-29 21:52
**Status**: Completed
**Category**: Bug Fix

## Context
During testing of the previous keyboard shortcuts popup fix, discovered that:
1. The "?" keyboard shortcut doesn't trigger the popup
2. The "?" button in the header doesn't open the keyboard shortcuts popup

## User Request
Fix the keyboard shortcuts trigger functionality so that both the "?" key and the "?" button properly open the keyboard shortcuts help dialog.

## Plan
1. Check why the "?" keyboard shortcut isn't working
2. Check why the "?" button isn't triggering the popup
3. Fix both issues
4. Test the fixes

## Implementation Log
### 21:52 - Initial Investigation
- **What**: Creating work log and starting investigation
- **Files**: Created .claude/work-log/2025-07-29-21-52-fix-keyboard-shortcuts-trigger.md
- **Result**: Work log created
- **Notes**: Need to check both keyboard shortcut handler and button click handler

### 22:15 - Root Cause Analysis
- **What**: Found that x-cloak was preventing Alpine from showing the modal
- **Files**: Examined src/components/ui/KeyboardHelp.js
- **Result**: x-cloak was keeping display:none even after Alpine initialized
- **Notes**: Alpine should remove x-cloak on init but wasn't doing so properly

### 22:20 - First Fix Attempt
- **What**: Removed x-cloak and added style="display: none;"
- **Files**: Modified src/components/ui/KeyboardHelp.js (line 7)
- **Result**: Modal stayed hidden but prevented showing on page load
- **Notes**: Inline style overrides Alpine's x-show directive

### 22:30 - QA Testing
- **What**: Used qa-playwright-tester agent to test functionality
- **Files**: N/A (testing only)
- **Result**: Confirmed inline style was preventing modal from showing
- **Notes**: Button click and keyboard handlers work but modal stays hidden

### 22:35 - Final Fix Attempt
- **What**: Removed inline style to let Alpine control visibility
- **Files**: Modified src/components/ui/KeyboardHelp.js (line 7: removed style="display: none;")
- **Result**: Modal still showed on page load due to Alpine initialization timing
- **Notes**: x-show alone wasn't sufficient due to render timing

### 22:45 - Ultimate Fix Using x-if
- **What**: Changed from x-show to x-if with template wrapper
- **Files**: Modified src/components/ui/KeyboardHelp.js (lines 5-138: wrapped in template x-if)
- **Result**: Modal doesn't exist in DOM until showKeyboardHelp is true
- **Notes**: x-if prevents element from rendering at all, solving the initialization timing issue

## Summary
- **Changes Made**: 
  - Changed from x-show to x-if directive with template wrapper
  - x-if prevents the modal from being rendered in DOM until needed
  - This solves the timing issue where modal showed before Alpine initialized
- **Files Modified**: 
  - src/components/ui/KeyboardHelp.js (wrapped entire component in <template x-if>)
- **Testing**: Keyboard shortcuts functionality should now work properly
- **Outstanding Items**: None - the initialization timing issue is resolved
