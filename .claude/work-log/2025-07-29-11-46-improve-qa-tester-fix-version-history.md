# Task: Improve QA Tester and Fix Version History UI Issues
**Date**: 2025-07-29 11:46
**Status**: Completed
**Category**: Bug Fix / Enhancement

## Context
User found UI issues that the qa-playwright-tester didn't catch:
1. Version History panel is not wide enough when visual comparison is enabled
2. Hovering over version items causes formatting issues

## User Request
"Can we first look though `./claude/agents/qa-playwright-tester.md` to see if we can improve it in a generic way to be able to find those type of issues in the future but not calling out this specific task. Then fix the issues I did mention and try to test them again"

## Plan
1. Enhance qa-playwright-tester.md to better catch UI/UX issues:
   - Add checks for panel/modal sizing and usability
   - Add hover state testing
   - Add viewport analysis for content readability
   - Add layout shift detection
2. Fix the Version History panel width issue
3. Fix the hover formatting issue
4. Test the fixes with the improved QA tester
