# Task: Question Type Enhancements
**Date**: 2025-07-27 13:43
**Status**: Completed
**Category**: Feature

## Context
User requested comprehensive analysis of all 30 question types comparing our implementation with Qualtrics functionality. Need to enhance each question type with appropriate settings and variations while maintaining our ultrathin design aesthetic.

## User Request
"I want you to go through each QuestionType separately, analyze our solution and responding research for that question type. Once you understand that I want to keep our UI and approach to UX, analyze what type of options or functionality we should add or change to make the question work and make sense from user perspective. User friendliness, clean modern ultrathin design are really important."

## Plan
Enhance all 30 question types in 5 phases:
- Phase 1: Core Enhancements - Update data models and settings panel
- Phase 2: Essential & Rating Types (12 types)
- Phase 3: Advanced & Input Types (12 types)  
- Phase 4: Media & Interactive Types (6 types)
- Phase 5: Testing & Polish
