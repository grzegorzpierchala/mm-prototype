# Task: Fix Question Type Naming Mismatches
**Date**: 2025-07-28 13:57
**Status**: In Progress
**Category**: Bug Fix

## Context
Several question types have mismatched names between the dropdown menu and the actual implementation in QuestionRenderer.js. This causes the questions to not render when selected from the dropdown.

## User Request
Fix the naming mismatches for question types so they work correctly when selected from the Add Question dropdown.

## Plan
Phase 1 - Quick fixes for naming mismatches:
1. Change sum_100 → constant_sum
2. Change image_select → image_choice  
3. Change video_record → video_response
4. Change audio_record → audio_response
