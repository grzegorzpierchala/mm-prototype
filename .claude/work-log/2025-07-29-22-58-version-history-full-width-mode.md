# Task: Implement Full-Width Mode for Version History Comparison
**Date**: 2025-07-29 22:58
**Status**: Planning
**Category**: Feature

## Context
The Version History panel is currently too cramped when comparing two versions side by side. Users need more space to properly read and compare the content of different versions.

## User Request
Implement a full-width mode that activates when users select 2 versions for comparison.

Requirements:
1. When 2 versions are selected for comparison, expand the Version History panel to take the full width of the screen
2. Keep the regular sidebar width when viewing single versions or the version list
3. Implement smooth transitions between regular and full-width modes
4. Ensure the side-by-side comparison has adequate space for readability
5. The main survey editor content should be hidden or pushed aside when in full-width mode
6. Add proper spacing and layout for the comparison view

## Plan
Since this is a UI/UX task involving layout changes, transitions, and visual improvements, I will delegate this to the ui-ux-designer agent. The task involves:
- Modifying the VersionHistory.js component
- Implementing responsive layout changes based on comparison mode
- Adding smooth transitions between states
- Ensuring proper spacing and readability
- Following the ultrathin design aesthetic

## Implementation Log
### 22:58 - Task Delegation
- **What**: Delegating UI implementation to ui-ux-designer agent
- **Files**: survey-editor-vite/src/components/ui/VersionHistory.js
- **Result**: Pending delegation
- **Notes**: This is a UI/UX task that requires design expertise and Tailwind CSS implementation

### 23:05 - Analysis of Current Implementation
- **What**: Reviewed current Version History panel in the application
- **Files**: None
- **Result**: Panel currently shows side-by-side comparison with dropdown selectors
- **Notes**: The panel appears to be a right sidebar that doesn't expand to full width when comparing versions. The comparison view is cramped with limited space for content.

### 23:10 - Delegating to UI/UX Designer
- **What**: Delegating the full-width mode implementation to ui-ux-designer agent
- **Files**: survey-editor-vite/src/components/ui/VersionHistory.js, survey-editor-vite/src/stores/versionStore.js
- **Result**: Task delegated
- **Notes**: This is a UI/UX task requiring layout changes, transitions, and visual design expertise
