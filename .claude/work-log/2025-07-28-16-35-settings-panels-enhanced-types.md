2. **Side by Side Settings**:
   - Add/remove/edit columns
   - Configure column types (text, radio, checkbox, scale, etc.)
   - Add/remove/edit rows
   - Column-specific settings

3. **Constant Sum Settings**:
   - Set total value
   - Toggle visual bars
   - Configure decimal places
   - Min/max per item

4. **Ranking Settings**:
   - Toggle visual feedback options
   - Allow ties setting
   - Force all ranked setting
   - Show numbers setting
