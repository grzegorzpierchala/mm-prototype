# Task: Implement Full-Width Mode for Version History Panel
**Date**: 2025-07-29 23:02
**Status**: In Progress
**Category**: Feature

## Context
The user wants to implement a full-width mode for the Version History panel that activates when comparing two different versions. This will provide more space for the side-by-side comparison view while maintaining the regular sidebar width for single version viewing.

## User Request
Implement the full-width mode for the Version History panel based on the approved plan. The implementation should:
1. Detect when two different versions are selected for comparison
2. Expand the panel to full width smoothly
3. Provide adequate space for the side-by-side comparison
4. Keep regular sidebar width when viewing single versions
5. Add smooth transitions following the ultrathin design aesthetic

## Plan
1. Read and understand current Version History component implementation
2. Check the version store to understand comparison state management
3. Implement comparison mode detection logic
4. Add dynamic width classes based on comparison mode
5. Ensure smooth transitions with proper CSS
6. Test the implementation using Playwright

## Implementation Log
### 23:02 - Initial Setup
- **What**: Created work log file and beginning to read current implementation
- **Files**: Created .claude/work-log/2025-07-29-23-02-implement-version-history-full-width-mode.md
- **Result**: Work log created successfully
- **Notes**: Following mandatory work documentation process

### 23:05 - Analysis of Current Implementation
- **What**: Read and analyzed Version History component and related files
- **Files**: 
  - Read survey-editor-vite/src/components/ui/VersionHistory.js (lines 1-456)
  - Read survey-editor-vite/src/stores/versionStore.js (lines 1-590)
  - Read survey-editor-vite/src/style.css (lines 890-1039)
- **Result**: Found current implementation details:
  - Version History panel has fixed width of 520px
  - Already has leftVersion and rightVersion in store for comparison
  - CSS already has .version-history-panel.expanded class (width: calc(100vw - 60px))
  - Panel uses Alpine.js for reactivity
- **Notes**: The expanded class already exists in CSS but is not being used. Need to add logic to detect when different versions are selected and apply the expanded class dynamically

### 23:07 - Implemented Full-Width Mode Logic
- **What**: Added dynamic expanded class based on version comparison state
- **Files**: 
  - Modified survey-editor-vite/src/components/ui/VersionHistory.js (lines 14-17)
  - Modified survey-editor-vite/src/style.css (line 905)
- **Result**: 
  - Added conditional class binding: 'expanded' when leftVersion !== rightVersion
  - Updated CSS transition for smoother width animation using cubic-bezier
- **Notes**: The panel will now expand to full width when two different versions are selected for comparison

### 23:10 - Testing Implementation
- **What**: Tested the full-width mode functionality using Playwright
- **Files**: No files modified during testing
- **Result**: 
  - ✅ Panel successfully expands to full width when comparing different versions (v1 vs v3)
  - ✅ Panel returns to regular width (520px) when same versions are selected (v3 vs v3)
  - ✅ Transitions are smooth with cubic-bezier easing
  - ✅ Side-by-side comparison has adequate space in expanded mode
- **Notes**: Implementation working as expected, meeting all requirements

## Summary
- **Changes Made**: 
  - Added dynamic class binding to detect when different versions are selected
  - Updated CSS transition for smoother width animations
- **Files Modified**: 
  - survey-editor-vite/src/components/ui/VersionHistory.js (lines 14-17)
  - survey-editor-vite/src/style.css (line 905)
- **Testing**: Successfully tested with Playwright MCP server
- **Outstanding Items**: None - feature is complete and working as intended
