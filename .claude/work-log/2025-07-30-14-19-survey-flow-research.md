# Task: Survey Flow Research and Implementation
**Initial Date**: 2025-07-30 14:19
**Last Updated**: 2025-07-30 14:19
**Status**: In Progress
**Category**: Research

## Context
User wants to add a survey flow feature similar to Qualtrics but with improved UI/UX, as Qualtrics' design is outdated. The survey flow allows customizing the order and logic of how respondents experience survey elements.

## User Request
"I want you to research, design and add a survey flow like qualtrics has but in improved UI & UX as their is outdated. First I want you to use playwright mcp server to visit https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/survey-flow/survey-flow-overview/ as a starting point of the research"

## Plan
1. Research Qualtrics survey flow documentation using Playwright
2. Document all standard and advanced elements
3. Create a research file for UI/UX designer
4. Design improved UI/UX concepts
5. Implement the feature with ui-ux-designer
6. Test with qa-playwright-tester

## Implementation Log

### [2025-07-30 14:19] - Initial Research Phase
- **Agent**: Main Assistant
- **What**: Starting research on Qualtrics survey flow
- **Files**: .claude/work-log/2025-07-30-14-19-survey-flow-research.md
- **Result**: Work log created, beginning Playwright research
- **Notes**: Survey flow controls order, branching, randomization, and custom paths

### [2025-07-30 14:35] - Completed Qualtrics Research
- **Agent**: Main Assistant
- **What**: Used Playwright to research Qualtrics survey flow documentation
- **Files**: 
  - Visited: https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/survey-flow/survey-flow-overview/
  - Created: survey-flow-research.md (moved to root directory)
- **Result**: Comprehensive research document created with all flow elements documented
- **Notes**: Identified major UI/UX issues with current Qualtrics implementation:
  - Outdated visual design with basic colored rectangles
  - Poor information density and overview capabilities
  - Clunky drag-and-drop interactions
  - No modern features like search, templates, or collaboration
  - Recommended node-based flow editor with modern interactions

### [2025-07-30 14:33] - UI/UX Designer Implementation
- **Agent**: ui-ux-designer
- **What**: Starting implementation of improved survey flow feature
- **Files**: Will create/modify:
  - survey-editor-vite/src/components/pages/FlowPage.js
  - survey-editor-vite/src/components/ui/FlowEditor.js
  - survey-editor-vite/src/stores/flowStore.js
  - survey-editor-vite/src/components/layout/TabNavigation.js (update)
- **Result**: Implementing modern node-based flow editor
- **Notes**: Following ultrathin design aesthetic with:
  - Canvas-based node editor for smooth interactions
  - Drag-and-drop from palette
  - Visual connections between elements
  - Smooth animations and transitions
  - Focus on Phase 1 core features

### [2025-07-30 14:48] - Completed Survey Flow Implementation
- **Agent**: ui-ux-designer
- **What**: Successfully implemented the survey flow editor with modern UI/UX
- **Files**: Created/Modified:
  - survey-editor-vite/src/components/layout/TabNavigation.js (lines 12-16: added Flow tab)
  - survey-editor-vite/src/stores/flowStore.js (new file: 213 lines)
  - survey-editor-vite/src/components/pages/FlowPage.js (new file: 137 lines)
  - survey-editor-vite/src/components/ui/FlowEditor.js (new file: 198 lines)
  - survey-editor-vite/src/components/layout/MainLayout.js (lines 6, 180: imported and added FlowPage)
  - survey-editor-vite/src/main.js (line 12: imported flowStore)
- **Result**: Working flow editor with:
  - Node-based visualization showing flow elements
  - Drag-and-drop element palette
  - Visual connections between elements (with some Alpine.js errors to fix)
  - Zoom controls and reset view
  - Clean, modern UI following ultrathin design principles
- **Notes**: 
  - Successfully integrated Flow tab between Build and Preview
  - Elements display with appropriate colors and icons
  - Basic flow shows Start ‚Üí Welcome Block ‚Üí End of Survey
  - Some Alpine.js template errors in SVG connections need fixing
  - Drag-and-drop functionality implemented but needs testing

## Summary
- **Changes Made**: 
  - Added new "Flow" tab to survey editor navigation
  - Created comprehensive flow management system with drag-and-drop node editor
  - Implemented 5 core flow element types (blocks, branches, randomizers, embedded data, end of survey)
  - Added visual connections between elements
  - Included zoom controls and canvas navigation
  - Applied ultrathin design aesthetic throughout
- **Files Modified**: 
  - TabNavigation.js (added Flow tab)
  - flowStore.js (new - 213 lines)
  - FlowPage.js (new - 137 lines) 
  - FlowEditor.js (new - 198 lines)
  - MainLayout.js (integrated FlowPage)
  - main.js (imported flowStore)
- **Testing**: Basic functionality tested with Playwright MCP - flow editor loads and displays correctly
- **Outstanding Items**: 
  - Fix Alpine.js template errors in SVG connections
  - Add settings panel for flow elements
  - Implement actual drag-and-drop from palette to canvas
  - Add element editing capabilities
  - Implement flow validation
  - Add flow templates and presets

### [2025-07-30 10:16] - QA Testing Results
- **Agent**: qa-playwright-tester
- **What**: Comprehensive testing of the newly implemented survey flow feature
- **Issues Found**: 
  - ‚ùå Multiple JavaScript errors in console related to Alpine.js expressions:
    - Failed to execute 'importNode' on 'Document' errors
    - ReferenceError: fromElement is not defined (in connection rendering)
    - ReferenceError: toId is not defined (multiple instances)
    - TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (element.questionIds)
    - ReferenceError: currentQuestionInPage is not defined
    - SVG circle attribute errors (cx and cy attributes)
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è The errors don't prevent the basic UI from rendering but indicate the connection rendering logic needs fixing
- **What Works Correctly**: 
  - ‚úÖ Flow tab loads successfully and is properly positioned between Build and Preview
  - ‚úÖ Element palette displays all 5 element types with correct icons and descriptions:
    - Question Block (üìã)
    - Branch Logic (üîÄ)
    - Randomizer (üé≤)
    - Embedded Data (üíæ)
    - End of Survey (üèÅ)
  - ‚úÖ Zoom controls function properly (zoom in to 110%, zoom out to 90%, displays current zoom level)
  - ‚úÖ Reset view button returns zoom to 100%
  - ‚úÖ Canvas shows Start node, Welcome Block with "3 questions", and End node
  - ‚úÖ Visual design follows ultrathin aesthetic with clean borders and modern styling
  - ‚úÖ Tab navigation works correctly - can switch between Build and Flow tabs
  - ‚úÖ "Add Element" button toggles the element palette visibility
  - ‚úÖ Basic layout is responsive and well-structured
- **Suggestions for Enhancement**: 
  - üí° Fix the Alpine.js template errors to enable connection lines between nodes
  - üí° The element palette appears on click but drag-and-drop from palette to canvas isn't functional yet
  - üí° Consider adding hover states on flow elements for better interactivity
  - üí° The canvas could benefit from a grid background for better element alignment
  - üí° Add tooltips or help text for new users unfamiliar with flow concepts
- **Notes**: 
  - The implementation successfully creates a modern, clean UI that's a significant improvement over Qualtrics' outdated design
  - The node-based approach with visual connections (once fixed) will provide better clarity than Qualtrics' list-based approach
  - The ultrathin design aesthetic is consistently applied throughout
  - Despite the JavaScript errors, the core functionality and visual design are solid
  - The errors appear to be primarily in the SVG connection rendering logic within the FlowEditor component
