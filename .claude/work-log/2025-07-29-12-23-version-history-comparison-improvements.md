# Task: Version History Comparison Experience Improvements
**Date**: 2025-07-29 12:23
**Status**: Planning
**Category**: Feature

## Context
The current version history comparison view in the survey editor doesn't effectively show users what actually changed between versions. It only shows change descriptions rather than the actual survey content, making it difficult for non-technical users to understand the differences.

## User Request
Design and implement an improved Version History comparison experience with:
1. True side-by-side preview showing actual survey content from each version
2. Visual diff indicators (green for added, blue for modified, red for removed)
3. Diff toggle control to show/hide diff highlights
4. Synchronized scrolling between panels
5. Clear visual hierarchy between current and selected versions

## Plan
1. Review current VersionHistory.js implementation and understand the structure
2. Read CLAUDE_UI_UX.md to understand design patterns
3. Design the improved comparison layout with:
   - Two panels showing actual survey content
   - Diff toggle switch in the header
   - Visual indicators for changes
   - Synchronized scrolling mechanism
4. Implement the following features:
   - Render actual survey questions in each panel
   - Add diff highlighting system
   - Create toggle control for diff visibility
   - Implement synchronized scrolling
   - Enhance visual hierarchy
5. Test the implementation with playwright

## Implementation Log
### 12:23 - Initial Assessment
- **What**: Creating work log and planning the implementation
- **Files**: Created `.claude/work-log/2025-07-29-12-23-version-history-comparison-improvements.md`
- **Result**: Work log created with initial plan
- **Notes**: This is a UI/UX task that requires careful design consideration

### 12:25 - Reviewed Current Implementation
- **What**: Analyzed VersionHistory.js, versionStore.js, and related styles
- **Files**: 
  - `survey-editor-vite/src/components/ui/VersionHistory.js` (lines 1-315)
  - `survey-editor-vite/src/stores/versionStore.js` (lines 1-204)
  - `survey-editor-vite/src/style.css` (version/diff related styles)
- **Result**: Identified key issues:
  - Current comparison only shows change descriptions, not actual survey content
  - Selected version panel shows placeholder content rather than real survey data
  - No synchronized scrolling between panels
  - Diff toggle exists but doesn't control visual indicators effectively
- **Notes**: Need to enhance versionStore to include survey snapshots for each version

### 12:30 - Enhanced Version Store with Survey Snapshots
- **What**: Added complete survey snapshots to each version in the store
- **Files**: `survey-editor-vite/src/stores/versionStore.js` (lines 10-203)
- **Result**: 
  - Added surveySnapshot property to all versions containing full survey state
  - Enhanced diff helper methods to check changes between versions
  - Added questionId tracking to changes for better diff matching
- **Notes**: Now each version contains the complete survey state as it was at that point in time

### 12:35 - Implemented True Side-by-Side Comparison
- **What**: Redesigned the version comparison view to show actual survey content
- **Files**: 
  - `survey-editor-vite/src/components/ui/VersionHistory.js` (lines 20-313)
  - `survey-editor-vite/src/style.css` (lines 894-1046)
- **Result**: 
  - Enhanced header with improved diff toggle using toggle switch component
  - Added diff legend that appears when diff mode is active
  - Implemented synchronized scrolling between panels
  - Current version panel shows live survey with diff indicators
  - Selected version panel shows historical survey snapshot
  - Added visual indicators for added/modified/removed questions
  - Improved empty state when no version is selected
- **Notes**: Synchronized scrolling works bidirectionally between panels

### 12:45 - Tested Implementation with Playwright
- **What**: Thoroughly tested the version history comparison improvements
- **Files**: None (testing only)
- **Result**: 
  - Verified version selection triggers side-by-side comparison view
  - Confirmed diff toggle shows/hides visual indicators correctly
  - Tested that actual survey content is displayed in both panels
  - Verified diff highlighting for added (green), modified (blue), and removed (red) content
  - Confirmed synchronized scrolling functionality
  - Visual hierarchy clearly distinguishes current vs selected version
- **Notes**: All features working as designed, providing clear comparison experience for non-technical users

## Summary
- **Changes Made**: 
  - Enhanced versionStore.js to include full survey snapshots for each version
  - Completely redesigned VersionHistory.js component with true side-by-side comparison
  - Updated CSS with improved diff highlighting and synchronized scrolling styles
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `survey-editor-vite/src/stores/versionStore.js` (lines 10-258)
  - `survey-editor-vite/src/components/ui/VersionHistory.js` (lines 20-313) 
  - `survey-editor-vite/src/style.css` (lines 894-1046)
- **Testing**: Successfully tested all features with playwright browser automation
- **Outstanding Items**: None - implementation complete and working as designed
