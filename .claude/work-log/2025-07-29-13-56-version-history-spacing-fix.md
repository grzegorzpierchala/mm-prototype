# Task: Fix Version History Panel Spacing and Readability Issues
**Date**: 2025-07-29 13:56
**Status**: Completed
**Category**: Bug Fix

## Context
User reports serious spacing and readability issues in the Version History panel. The visual comparison text is cramped and overlapping, panel is too narrow, text is getting cut off, and preview panels are too small.

## User Request
"Why is it so packed? I cannot see anything or read anything there"

Issues identified:
1. Visual comparison text is completely cramped and overlapping
2. Panel seems too narrow
3. Text is getting cut off
4. No proper spacing between elements
5. Preview panels are way too small

## Plan
1. Increase panel width when visual comparison is enabled (currently uses 90vw, may need adjustment)
2. Fix text spacing throughout with proper padding and margins
3. Improve visual comparison area with more vertical space
4. Fix overlapping text in preview panels
5. Improve typography with proper line-height
6. Ensure layout is spacious and follows ultrathin design aesthetic
