# Task: Version History UI Improvements
**Date**: 2025-07-29 12:40
**Status**: Completed
**Category**: Feature

## Context
The version store now has surveySnapshot data on each version containing the full survey state at that point in time. The UI needs to be updated to show actual survey data comparison instead of placeholders.

## User Request
Implement improved Version History UI with:
1. Update Visual Comparison Section to show real survey data from surveySnapshot
2. Add "Show differences" toggle controlling $store.versions.showDiffHighlights
3. Implement visual diff logic for added/modified/removed questions
4. Add synchronized scrolling between panels
5. Visual improvements following ultrathin design aesthetic

## Plan
1. Replace placeholder content in Visual Comparison section with actual survey data
2. Update the toggle to control showDiffHighlights instead of showVisualDiff
3. Enhance question rendering to support all question types (nps, email, phone, etc.)
4. Implement proper diff highlighting logic
5. Add synchronized scrolling functionality
6. Ensure proper visual hierarchy and spacing
