# Task: Implement Priority Grid Question Type
**Date**: 2025-07-28 15:05
**Status**: In Progress
**Category**: Feature

## Context
Priority Grid is a missing question type that was identified in the analysis. It allows respondents to place items on a 2x2 grid based on two dimensions (e.g., importance vs. urgency).

## User Request
Implement the priority_grid question type as part of Phase 2 of the question types implementation plan.

## Plan
1. Add priority_grid template to QuestionRenderer.js
2. Create default settings in surveyEditor.js
3. Ensure validation is working (already exists in validation.js)
4. Test the implementation with Playwright
