# Task: Merge originalStyles.css into style.css
**Date**: 2025-07-28 16:15
**Status**: Completed
**Category**: Refactor

## Context
Originally planned to delete originalStyles.css, but discovered it's actually imported in main.js AFTER style.css, meaning it overrides duplicate properties. Need to merge both files properly to maintain current styling behavior.

## User Request
"wait so in the end the previous styles were imported, then let's merge them into main so we dont have 2 classes of the same name that makes it more difficult to make adjustments, when merging classes keep in mind that originalstyles was imported as second so it was overriding same props that style would have for it classes"

## Plan
1. Identify all duplicate classes between the files
2. For each duplicate, keep the originalStyles.css version (since it overrides)
3. Add any unique classes from originalStyles.css to style.css
4. Remove the originalStyles.css import from main.js
5. Delete originalStyles.css
