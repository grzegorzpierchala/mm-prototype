# Task: Add Settings Button to Question Actions
**Date**: 2025-07-28 15:50
**Status**: Completed
**Category**: Feature

## Context
User wants to add a Settings button in the Question Actions area, to the right of the Required toggle. The settings panel should still open when clicking anywhere on the question (current behavior), not just when clicking the settings button.

## User Request
"Let's now add a Settings button in Question Actions, to the right of required button. But keep the way settings tab opens right now, that user does not need to press exactly the settings button"

## Plan
1. Find the Question Actions area in the QuestionRenderer component
2. Add a Settings button with an appropriate icon
3. Ensure the button is positioned to the right of the Required toggle
4. Maintain the existing click-anywhere functionality
5. Style the button consistently with other action buttons
6. Test with Playwright
