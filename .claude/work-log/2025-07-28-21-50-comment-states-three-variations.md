# Task: Remove Avatars and Add Three Comment States
**Date**: 2025-07-28 21:50
**Status**: Completed
**Category**: Feature

## Context
User wants to simplify the comment indicator by removing participant avatars and demonstrate three distinct comment states with different questions.

## User Request
Remove the people that commented, and add another question to show three states:
1. First question: Has comments
2. Second question: No comments
3. Third question: Comments with unread messages

## Plan
1. Remove participant avatars from QuestionRenderer.js
2. Simplify the comment indicator to just show icon and count
3. Add a third question to the survey
4. Implement unread comments functionality in commentStore
5. Update CSS for the three states
