# Task: Analyze and Update UI/UX Documentation
**Initial Date**: 2025-07-31 09:03
**Last Updated**: 2025-07-31 09:03
**Status**: Completed
**Category**: Research

## Context
User requested analysis of the survey-editor-vite project to ensure CLAUDE_UI_UX.md is up to date with the current implementation.

## User Request
"Can you analyze the project that is in @survey-editor-vite\ and make sure our @CLAUDE_UI_UX.md is up to date - think harder"

## Plan
1. Examine key component files in survey-editor-vite
2. Review stores and utils for architectural patterns
3. Check main entry points and pages
4. Compare findings with CLAUDE_UI_UX.md documentation
5. Identify discrepancies and outdated information
6. Update documentation as needed

## Implementation Log

### [2025-07-31 09:03] - Initial Analysis
- **Agent**: Main Assistant
- **What**: Starting analysis of project structure and key files
- **Files**: Multiple files to be examined
- **Result**: Beginning comprehensive review
- **Notes**: Will use TodoWrite to track analysis tasks

### [2025-07-31 09:10] - Key Findings from Analysis
- **Agent**: Main Assistant
- **What**: Analyzed main structure and components
- **Files**: main.js, MainLayout.js, TabNavigation.js, style.css, SettingsPanel.js, uiStore.js, TextInput.js, QuestionRenderer.js
- **Result**: Identified key architectural differences and patterns
- **Notes**: 
  1. Component-based architecture with Alpine.js for reactivity
  2. Vite development server at http://localhost:5173/
  3. Tab navigation includes Build, Flow, Preview, Share, Results*, Analytics*, Settings
  4. Settings panel is 380px wide as documented
  5. Question types are organized in categories (Essentials, Rating, Input, Advanced, Media, Interactive)
  6. Uses Alpine.js stores for state management (surveyStore, uiStore, commentStore, versionStore, validationStore, flowStore)
  7. Drag and drop functionality implemented with custom handlers
  8. Toggle switches follow documented dimensions (44x24px base, 36x20px small)
  9. Page break functionality implemented with hover zones
  10. Flow editor with canvas-based visual flow design

### [2025-07-31 09:15] - Documentation Update Completed
- **Agent**: Main Assistant
- **What**: Updated CLAUDE_UI_UX.md with current implementation details
- **Files**: CLAUDE_UI_UX.md
- **Result**: Documentation now reflects the Vite-based component architecture
- **Notes**: Major updates include:
  - Changed reference from prototype.html to survey-editor-vite
  - Updated all line number references to file paths
  - Added Flow tab to navigation
  - Documented new store architecture
  - Added Flow Editor component documentation
  - Added Page Break system documentation
  - Updated component locations and implementation details
  - Preserved all design tokens and patterns

## Summary
- **Changes Made**: Updated CLAUDE_UI_UX.md to reflect current Vite-based implementation
- **Files Modified**: 
  - M:\Projects\mm-prototype\CLAUDE_UI_UX.md (13 comprehensive edits)
- **Testing**: Visual review of documentation accuracy against implementation
- **Outstanding Items**: None - documentation is now up to date with the current implementation
