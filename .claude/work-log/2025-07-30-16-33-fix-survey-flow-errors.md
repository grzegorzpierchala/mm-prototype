   - UI layout is clean and properly structured

2. **Drag-and-Drop Functionality**
   - ✅ Palette opens successfully when clicking "Add Element" button
   - ✅ All flow element types display correctly in the palette
   - ✅ Successfully dragged "Question Block" from palette to canvas
   - ✅ Element appears at the correct drop position
   - ✅ Palette auto-closes after successful drop (though not visible in final state)
   - ✅ Delete button works - successfully removed the added Question Block

3. **Visual Feedback**
   - ✅ Hover states appear to be working (tested programmatically)
   - ✅ Elements have proper styling and are clearly distinguishable
   - ✅ Connection points visible on flow elements

4. **Zoom Controls**

   - Errors about `element.questionIds.length` reading undefined
   - These errors appear to be from the Build tab but persist in console

2. **SVG Connections**
   - Connection lines between flow elements are not visible
   - This was mentioned as temporarily disabled in the implementation notes

### ⚠️ Potential Improvements or Concerns
1. **Error Isolation**
   - The Alpine.js errors from the Build tab pollute the console even when on Flow tab
   - Consider isolating tab-specific code to prevent cross-tab errors

2. **Visual Polish**
   - While functional, the drag preview could be enhanced
   - Drop zone highlighting wasn't clearly visible during testing

3. **Reordering Existing Elements**
   - Unable to test dragging existing flow elements to reorder
   - This was noted as needing refinement in implementation

### 💡 Suggestions for Enhancement
1. **Fix Build Tab Errors First**
   - The `currentQuestionInPage` errors should be resolved as they indicate broken functionality
   - These errors may affect overall application stability

2. **Implement Connection Lines**
   - Consider using a simpler SVG approach or HTML/CSS based connections
   - Could use absolute positioned divs with borders as a temporary solution

3. **Enhanced Visual Feedback**
   - Add more prominent drop zone highlighting
   - Consider adding a ghost element showing where the item will be placed

4. **Testing Coverage**
   - Test with multiple elements to ensure proper spacing
   - Test zoom levels with drag-and-drop operations
   - Verify elements maintain position after page refresh

### Test Screenshots
- Initial state: flow-initial-state.png
- Palette open: flow-palette-open.png
- After drag-drop: flow-drag-drop-success.png
- After delete: flow-after-delete.png

### Overall Assessment
The core drag-and-drop functionality has been successfully implemented and works as expected. Users can add flow elements from the palette to the canvas, which is the primary requirement. However, the presence of Alpine.js errors from other parts of the application and the missing connection lines prevent this from being a fully polished feature. The implementation is functional for demonstration purposes but needs additional refinement for production use.
