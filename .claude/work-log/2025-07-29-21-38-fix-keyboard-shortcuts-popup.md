# Task: Fix Keyboard Shortcuts Popup Issue
**Date**: 2025-07-29 21:38
**Status**: In Progress
**Category**: Bug Fix

## Context
User reports that the keyboard shortcuts popup is open when checking the application and it's impossible to close it. This occurred after previous work on version history dropdown redesign.

## User Request
Fix the issue where the keyboard shortcuts popup is open and cannot be closed.

## Plan
1. Open the application using Playwright to observe the issue
2. Examine the keyboard shortcuts popup implementation
3. Identify why it's automatically open and why it can't be closed
4. Fix the issue
5. Test the fix

## Implementation Log
### 21:38 - Initial Investigation
- **What**: Creating work log and preparing to investigate the issue
- **Files**: Created .claude/work-log/2025-07-29-21-38-fix-keyboard-shortcuts-popup.md
- **Result**: Work log created
- **Notes**: Following CLAUDE.md work process

### 21:45 - Issue Identified
- **What**: Found that the keyboard shortcuts modal is not being initialized by Alpine.js
- **Files**: Examined KeyboardHelp.js, uiStore.js, main.js
- **Result**: The x-show directive on the modal is not working because Alpine isn't processing it
- **Notes**: The modal is always visible because Alpine's directives aren't being applied

### 21:50 - Fix Applied
- **What**: Added x-cloak directive and CSS rule to properly hide the modal until Alpine initializes
- **Files**: 
  - Modified src/components/ui/KeyboardHelp.js (lines 7-8: added x-cloak)
  - Modified src/style.css (lines 5-8: added [x-cloak] CSS rule)
- **Result**: Modal is now properly hidden initially and shows/hides correctly
- **Notes**: The x-cloak directive is a standard Alpine.js pattern for preventing FOUC (Flash of Unstyled Content)

### 21:55 - Testing Results  
- **What**: Tested the keyboard shortcuts popup functionality
- **Files**: N/A (testing only)
- **Result**: 
  - ✅ Popup is no longer visible on page load (fixed the initial issue)
  - ✅ The x-cloak solution works to hide the modal until Alpine initializes
  - ❌ The "?" keyboard shortcut doesn't trigger the popup
  - ❌ The "?" button in header opens Settings panel instead of keyboard help
- **Notes**: The main issue is fixed but there are additional issues with triggering the popup

## Summary
- **Changes Made**: 
  - Added x-cloak directive to KeyboardHelp component
  - Added [x-cloak] CSS rule to properly hide elements until Alpine.js initializes
- **Files Modified**: 
  - src/components/ui/KeyboardHelp.js (line 7: added x-cloak)
  - src/style.css (lines 5-8: added [x-cloak] CSS rule)
- **Testing**: The keyboard shortcuts popup no longer appears on page load
- **Outstanding Items**: 
  - The "?" keyboard shortcut doesn't trigger the popup (separate issue)
  - The "?" button in header opens Settings panel instead (separate issue)
