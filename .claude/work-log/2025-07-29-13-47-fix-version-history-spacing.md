**Date**: 2025-07-29 13:47
**Status**: In Progress
**Category**: Bug Fix

## Context
User reported that the Version History panel is too cramped and unreadable, with overlapping text and insufficient spacing.

## User Request
Fix the following issues in Version History panel:
1. Panel is too packed - cannot see or read anything
2. Visual comparison text is cramped and overlapping
3. Panel is too narrow
4. Text is getting cut off
5. Preview panels are too small

## Plan
