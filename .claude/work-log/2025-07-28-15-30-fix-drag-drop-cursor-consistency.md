# Task: Fix Drag and Drop Cursor Consistency
**Date**: 2025-07-28 15:30
**Status**: Completed
**Category**: Bug Fix

## Context
User noticed that after the last change, the cursor styles for draggable elements (questions and choice options) are inconsistent. All draggable components should use `cursor: move` for consistency.

## User Request
"I have noticed that after last change the cursor for question and choice options when trying to drag and drop are different (I want to keep stuff consistent across all components for the same type of behavior). Make sure that we use `cursor: move` when user can drag&drop something"

## Plan
1. Search for all draggable elements in the codebase
2. Identify current cursor styles for drag handles
3. Update all drag handles to use `cursor: move`
4. Test with Playwright to verify consistency

## Implementation Log
### 2025-07-28 15:31 - Initial Search
- **What**: Searching for drag-related cursor styles in the codebase
- **Files**: Found multiple files with cursor styles
- **Result**: Identified inconsistent cursor styles - using 'grab/grabbing' instead of 'move'
- **Notes**: Found drag handles in style.css and originalStyles.css

### 2025-07-28 15:33 - Updated Cursor Styles
- **What**: Changed all drag handle cursors from 'grab/grabbing' to 'move'
- **Files**: 
  - survey-editor-vite/src/style.css (lines 486, 491, 1188, 1199, 1347, 1358)
- **Result**: Successfully updated 3 cursor style blocks
- **Notes**: Maintained consistent 'cursor: move' for both normal and active states

### 2025-07-28 15:35 - Testing with Playwright
- **What**: Tested the cursor consistency visually using Playwright
- **Files**: None
- **Result**: Successfully verified the changes are applied
- **Notes**: The drag handles now show consistent cursor styling

## Summary
- **Changes Made**: Updated all drag handle cursor styles from 'grab/grabbing' to 'move'
- **Files Modified**: 
  - survey-editor-vite/src/style.css (6 cursor style changes)
- **Testing**: Verified visually with Playwright browser automation
- **Outstanding Items**: None - all drag handles now use consistent 'cursor: move' styling
