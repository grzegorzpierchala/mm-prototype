# Task: Enhance Complex Question Types
**Date**: 2025-07-28 15:11
**Status**: Completed
**Category**: Feature

## Context
Phase 3 of the question types implementation plan involves enhancing existing complex question types that are currently showing placeholder implementations.

## User Request
Continue with Phase 3: Enhance complex question types (constant_sum, rank_order, side_by_side, matrix).

## Plan
Based on the analysis, these complex types need enhancement:
1. **constant_sum** - Add visual bars, real-time total calculation
2. **rank_order** - Implement drag-and-drop ranking interface
3. **side_by_side** - Create multi-column question format
4. **matrix** - Build proper matrix table with various answer types

## Implementation Log
### 2025-07-28 15:11 - Starting Phase 3
- **What**: Beginning to enhance complex question types
- **Files**: QuestionRenderer.js
- **Result**: Starting with constant_sum enhancements
- **Notes**: Will add visual feedback and better UX

### 2025-07-28 15:25 - Enhanced constant_sum question type
- **What**: Added visual progress bars and real-time total calculation
- **Files**: QuestionRenderer.js (lines 1905-1993)
- **Result**: Constant sum now has:
  - Real-time total display with color coding (green when 100%, red when over, blue when under)
  - Progress bar showing total completion
  - Visual bars for each option showing percentage
  - Dynamic feedback messages
- **Notes**: The enhancement provides much better UX for users to understand their allocation

### 2025-07-28 15:35 - Enhanced ranking question type
- **What**: Improved drag-and-drop interface with visual feedback and arrow buttons
- **Files**: QuestionRenderer.js (lines 1836-1980)
- **Result**: Ranking now has:
  - Visual feedback during drag (opacity, scale, highlight drop zones)
  - Arrow buttons for keyboard-friendly reordering
  - Color-coded rank numbers (gold for 1st, silver for 2nd, bronze for 3rd)
  - Smooth transitions and hover effects
  - Instructions for users
- **Notes**: The enhancement makes ranking more intuitive and accessible

### 2025-07-28 15:40 - Fixed ranking question default options

- **Notes**: Will create a table structure with multiple question types per row

### 2025-07-28 15:50 - Enhanced side_by_side question type
- **What**: Replaced basic implementation with enhanced table format
- **Files**: QuestionRenderer.js (lines 2157-2354)
- **Result**: Side by side now has:
  - Full table layout with proper headers
  - Multiple column types: text, number, select, radio, checkbox, scale, star rating
  - Row-based organization with clear labels
  - Hover effects and transitions
  - Mobile responsive notice

- **Notes**: The enhancement provides a professional multi-column survey experience

### 2025-07-28 15:55 - Updated side_by_side default settings
- **What**: Added default columns and rows configuration
- **Files**: surveyEditor.js (lines 289-304)
- **Result**: Side by side questions now initialize with:
  - 3 columns (Satisfaction radio, Importance scale, Comments text)
  - 4 rows (Product Quality, Customer Service, Delivery Speed, Price Value)
- **Notes**: Provides a realistic example configuration

### 2025-07-28 16:00 - Tested side_by_side implementation
- **What**: Created and tested side_by_side question through UI
- **Files**: None (UI testing)
- **Result**: Successfully displayed the enhanced table with all column types working
- **Notes**: The table shows correctly with headers, multiple input types, and proper styling

### 2025-07-28 16:05 - Starting matrix enhancement
- **What**: Beginning to enhance matrix question type
- **Files**: QuestionRenderer.js
- **Result**: Working on matrix table implementation
- **Notes**: Will create a flexible matrix with multiple answer types

### 2025-07-28 16:10 - Enhanced matrix question type
- **What**: Replaced basic matrix with comprehensive implementation
- **Files**: QuestionRenderer.js (lines 1765-1979)
- **Result**: Matrix now supports:
  - Multiple matrix types: likert, bipolar, rank_order, constant_sum, text_entry, max_diff
  - Dynamic answer types: single choice (radio), multiple choice (checkbox)
  - Matrix type label showing current configuration
  - Constant sum with percentage inputs and total tracking
  - Text entry matrix for open-ended responses
  - MaxDiff with best/worst selection
  - Sticky row headers for better usability
