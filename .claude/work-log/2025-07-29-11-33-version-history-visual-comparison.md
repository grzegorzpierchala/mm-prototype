# Task: Implement Visual Version Comparison in Version History
**Date**: 2025-07-29 11:33
**Status**: Completed
**Category**: Feature

## Context
User wants to restore the visual version comparison functionality from survey-editor-prototype.html to the Vite version, allowing users to visually compare changes between versions.

## User Request
"Version History is not yet reflecting how it used to look like in @survey-editor-prototype.html. Can we bring back the old functionality were you could compare visually what changed between the versions."

## Plan
1. Analyze the version history implementation in survey-editor-prototype.html
2. Identify the visual comparison components and styling
3. Find the current version history implementation in survey-editor-vite
4. Port the visual diff functionality to the Vite version
5. Test with playwright to ensure the visual comparison works correctly

## Implementation Log
### [11:33] - Analysis Started
- **What**: Beginning analysis of version history implementations
- **Files**: survey-editor-prototype.html, survey-editor-vite components

- **Result**: Identified key differences and missing features
- **Notes**: Current Vite version has basic functionality but lacks:
  1. Visual diff indicators (diff-highlight classes)
  2. Change preview tooltips on hover

  6. Enhanced version data with oldText/newText for better diffs

### [12:10] - Testing and Bug Fix
