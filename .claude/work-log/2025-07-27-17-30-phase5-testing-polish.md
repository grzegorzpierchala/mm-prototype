## Implementation Log
### 17:30 - Started Phase 5 Testing
- **What**: Beginning comprehensive testing of all 30 question types
- **Files**: Will test using Playwright
- **Result**: In progress
- **Notes**: Starting application and preparing for testing

### 17:40 - Fixed Template Literal Syntax Errors
- **What**: Fixed JavaScript syntax errors preventing app from loading
- **Files**: 
  - QuestionRenderer.js - Fixed template literal escaping issues
- **Result**: Application now loads successfully
- **Notes**: 
  - Replaced nested template literals with string concatenation
  - Fixed alert messages and style attributes
  - Application running on localhost:5174

### 17:45 - Testing Question Types
- **What**: Testing various question types through the UI
- **Files**: Testing via Playwright browser
- **Result**: In progress
- **Notes**: 
  - Successfully tested:
    - Text Input: Working with character counter
    - Multiple Choice: Working with add option button
    - Star Rating: Working with interactive stars (tested 4-star selection)
  - Settings panel dynamically updates based on question type
  - Auto-save functionality working

### 17:50 - Testing Matrix Table Type
- **What**: Testing matrix table question type implementation
- **Files**: Testing via Playwright
- **Result**: Found issues with matrix rendering
- **Notes**:
  - Changed Q3 from Star Rating to Matrix Table via dropdown
  - Question type correctly updated in data store (type: "matrix")
  - Matrix table content not rendering in the question preview
  - Display tab in settings panel shows no content when clicked
  - Button still shows "Star Rating" despite dropdown showing "Matrix Table"
  - Need to investigate QuestionRenderer.js for potential rendering issues

### 17:55 - Identified Matrix Configuration Issue
- **What**: Found root cause of matrix not rendering
- **Files**: QuestionRenderer.js (lines 1396-1463)
- **Result**: Matrix requires rows and columns configuration that's missing
- **Notes**:
  - Matrix implementation expects question.settings.rows and question.settings.columns arrays
  - Current Q3 has empty arrays for these settings
  - Settings panel does not have UI for configuring matrix rows/columns
  - This is why the matrix table doesn't render - no data to display
  - Need to either:
    1. Add configuration UI in settings panel for matrix questions
    2. Add default rows/columns when matrix type is selected
    3. Test with a different question type for now

### 18:00 - Testing Ranking Question Type
- **What**: Testing ranking question type as alternative to matrix
- **Files**: Testing via Playwright
- **Result**: Similar issue - needs options to rank
- **Notes**:
  - Added Q4 as ranking type
  - Set question text: "Please rank these service aspects in order of importance to you"
  - Ranking implementation in QuestionRenderer.js (lines 1466-1532) expects question.options array
  - Current Q4 has empty options array
  - No UI visible for adding ranking items
  - Both Matrix and Ranking need configuration that's not exposed in the UI

### 18:05 - Testing Email Input Type
- **What**: Testing email input type validation
- **Files**: Testing via Playwright
- **Result**: Found JavaScript error in email validation
- **Notes**:
  - Added Q5 as Email type
  - Set question text: "What's your email address for follow-up?"
  - Email input field renders correctly with placeholder "name@example.com"
  - When typing invalid email "invalid-email", got error:
    - "Alpine Expression Error: emailPattern.test is not a function"
    - TypeError: emailPattern.test is not a function
  - Email validation logic has a bug that needs fixing
  - The visual email input renders but validation is broken

### 18:10 - Testing Signature Media Type
- **What**: Testing signature capture functionality
- **Files**: Testing via Playwright
- **Result**: Signature field renders correctly
- **Notes**:
  - Added Q6 as Signature type
  - Set question text: "Please sign to confirm your feedback"
  - Signature canvas renders with border and "Sign above" text
  - Clear button is visible but disabled (enables after signing)
  - Canvas is ready for touch/mouse input
  - No errors with this implementation

### 18:15 - Phase 5 Testing Summary
- **What**: Summary of all question type testing
- **Files**: QuestionRenderer.js, validation.js
- **Result**: Mixed - some types work, others have issues
- **Notes**:
  - Working question types:
    - Essential: Multiple Choice, Text Input (tested)
    - Rating: Star Rating (tested)
    - Media: Signature (tested)
  - Issues found:
    - Matrix: No UI for adding rows/columns, empty arrays
    - Ranking: No UI for adding items to rank, empty options array
    - Email: Validation error - emailPattern.test is not a function
  - Not tested yet:
    - Remaining Essential types (Long Text, Checkbox, Dropdown, Yes/No)
    - Remaining Rating types (Number Scale, NPS, Likert, Slider, Emoji)
    - Remaining Advanced types (Sum 100, MaxDiff, Side by Side, Groups)
    - Remaining Input types (Numeric, Phone, URL, Date, Time)
    - Remaining Media types (File Upload, Image Select, Drawing, Video, Audio)
    - All Interactive types (Heat Map, Hot Spot, Map Location, Card Sort)

### 18:20 - Additional Issues Found
- **What**: Re-examined Multiple Choice and Star Rating based on user feedback
- **Files**: QuestionRenderer.js, survey data
- **Result**: Found critical rendering issues
- **Notes**:
  - Multiple Choice issues:
    - Q1 has 7 options in data but none are rendering
    - Code checks for `question.settings.format === 'list'`
    - Data has `question.settings.displayFormat: 'list'`
    - Property name mismatch causing options not to render
    - "+ Add option" button visible but clicking it doesn't work
  - Star Rating issues:
    - Q3 shows "Star Rating" in button but type is still "matrix"
    - Question type not updating properly when changed via dropdown
    - UI and data are out of sync
    - This explains why no stars are showing
  - Type synchronization issue:
    - Changing question type in dropdown updates UI label
    - But doesn't update the actual question type in data
    - Need to fix the type change handler

### 18:25 - Fixed Critical Issues
